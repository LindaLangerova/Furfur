Gooood monday morning... dragon?! Want to join my dragon squad? No? Then you should first go anywhere else...  

I am looking for Blue scream of death, maybe you could know him.

Jeeez that one is a huge monster. I promise I've already heared of him... But maybe my lovely Flufflekins might be a bigger problem for you at the moment.

Who? 

The giant robodragon living in the mountain. If you want to go looking for your prey, you will need to get over him. But still you need to get enough karma to get up there. The mountain is protected by several gods as Heimdall, Loki, Zeus and the highest one.

Heimdall? Loki? The heck are you talking about? Why there are so many of them? 

Come on, It's 2018, no one leaves his mountain protected by only one god.

Oh god...

Heimdal:

(After Get)
2) Thank you little dragon, the path is now clear.


Loki:
1) The idol of Loki is glowing some energy that prevents you from continuing.
2) Thank you little dragon, the path is now clear.


Zeus:
1) Lightening around this one sends you vibres. It's obvious it belongs to Zeus.
2) Thaks creature! You are worthy to pass.

Hey buddy, how can I assist you? I have everything you ever wanted, if you buy one, you get 3 gratis! So?

Emmm... Well the highest god said that the e-quality of your shop is a bit poor. So maybe I could give him something that will change his mind and make him happy?

Ahh these fussy gods... Let's give him this equality, to see how he will React.
