Tux:
Hey you! Penguin!

Are you talking to me?

Yeah, who else? You're the first living being I've seen in a while. What the hell is happening here?

I have no clue what you're talking about. I guess nothing differs from everyday routine here. Just you... I can see you don't belong in there.                                                                      What are you doing here?

I wish I knew the answer... But I guess I need to find The Blue Scream of Death and ask him, can you direct me to him? 

Blue what? It doesn't say anything to me. But I can tell you he doesn't live here for sure. And unfortunately for you, it won't be easy to get out of here. You will need to get the power to get over the Null Terminator and continue in looking for your object of interrest... Cause there are no objects here... *hehe*

MemoryBoy:
Ohh... I was just too openminded and didn't take care of my memory very well... So it flew away! *snif*

...Have you seen my memory..? *snif*

That. Is. My. Memory!! <3 
How can I be gratefull enough? Here, take this. It's an ancient key, I got it from my granny. At least it looks good.

Wohoo, I can remember anything now!

Michal David:

Primitive data types:
Hey! You calling me primitive?! Me not primitive, you primitive!

You lightweight morron! Me put you in that cage! Rrrr!!!

What have you done.. what...? Well that doesn't feel so bad. You made some connection between us! No more just c and 99, we are brothers now.
